#Strling

The world's first stringly typed programming language! Strling approaches
programming in a never-before-seen way, leveraging
SOP (String Oriented Programming) to create programs that are both natural
and efficient. Just look how easy it is to print "Hello world" to the terminal!

```
println("Hello, world!")
```

The language is currently in a very early stage, and there are probably
a *lot* of bugs. Don't expect to get any useful error messages yet. Anyways,
check out the documentation in `docs/`!
